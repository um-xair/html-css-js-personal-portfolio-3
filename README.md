This HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code creates a simple portfolio website for showcasing personal information, projects, and contact details.

## HTML Structure:

- The HTML file starts with the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, indicating an HTML5 document.
- It contains two navigation bars, one for desktop view and one for mobile (hamburger) view.
- Sections are defined for profile, about, experience, projects, and contact information.
- Each section includes relevant content and links.

## CSS:

- The styling is split into two CSS files: `styles.css` and `mediaqueries.css`.
- `styles.css` contains general styles for the portfolio layout.
- `mediaqueries.css` includes styles for responsive design, adjusting layout and styling for different screen sizes.

## JavaScript (script.js):

- The `toggleMenu()` function toggles the visibility of the mobile navigation menu when the hamburger icon is clicked.
- Event listeners are added to the hamburger icon to trigger the `toggleMenu()` function.
- The script also includes functionality to hide and reveal the desktop navigation bar based on scroll direction.

### Explanation of Specific Parts:

- **Navigation Bars:** There are two navigation bars, one for desktop view (`desktop-nav`) and one for mobile view (`hamburger-nav`). They contain links to different sections of the portfolio.
- **Profile Section:** This section includes a profile picture, name, profession, social media links, and buttons to download CV and view contact information.
- **About Section:** Provides information about the individual's background, education, and a brief description.
- **Experience Section:** Lists the individual's experience in front-end and back-end technologies, along with proficiency levels.
- **Projects Section:** Displays recent projects with images, titles, and buttons linking to their GitHub repositories and live demos.
- **Contact Section:** Includes contact information, such as email and LinkedIn profile links.
- **Script for Navigation Bar:** The JavaScript code adds functionality to toggle the mobile menu and hide/show the desktop navigation bar based on scroll direction.

This simple portfolio effectively showcases personal information, experience, projects, and contact details in a clean and organized manner.
